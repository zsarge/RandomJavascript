Hello,

If I understood what you were talking about this should accomplish your goal.

I tried to explain what was happening in the commments, but don't be afraid to google stuff if you don't know what's going on.

`methodOne.js`, `methodTwo.js`, and `methodThree.js` are all the exact same, except for the object definition.

The output is in `output.txt` in case you don't have node on your computer.


Hope this helps!
